What is Global Warming Exactly?
How can you save the World ?
Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a gradual warming of the planet. The combustion of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes are significant contributors to the rise in greenhouse gas concentrations. The consequences of global warming are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heatwaves, disruptions in weather patterns, and the loss of biodiversity. Urgent and coordinated efforts are needed to mitigate the impact of global warming by transitioning to sustainable energy sources, implementing conservation measures, and fostering international cooperation to address this critical environmental challenge.
